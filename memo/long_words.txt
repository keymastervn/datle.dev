Well, here I express my points:

First, I team up with positivism, freedom, transparency, self-esteem, charisma. However, developers need to be skeptical and conservative to learn fast. Let's say I am a very open and listenable person while keeping my low-profile status.

Second, I don't trust any given stuff rather than coffee smoothies and candies shared between friends as kudos. We know recognitions work in some perspectives, but it does not spark joy for me.

I put myself into meta-thinking very often. Asking opinionated questions yield my karma, asking philosophy question then we are both doomed. Sometimes I am just talkative or point-blank due to multilateral ideas, so I would suggest someone stop me at a concern :pray:

Lastly, how about focusing on your current problems and my solutions?
